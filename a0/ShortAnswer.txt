1. Assume I plan to use the friend_overlap function above to quantify the
similarity of two users. E.g., because 344 is larger than 1, I conclude that
Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are more similar than Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump.

How is this approach misleading? How might you fix it?

If Jill Stein and Gary Johnson total have 1 million friends and only have 344 overlap friend. The percentage is (344+344)/1000000 =0.344%
Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump only have one friend and 1 overlap friend. the percentage is 100%

so , we need to use the sum of overlap number of friend to divide the total number of friend of the two people.
Such as (344 +344) / (400000+600000) and compare the percentage value.




2. Looking at the output of your followed_by_hillary_and_donald function, why
do you think this user is followed by both Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump,
who are rivals? Do some web searches to see if you can find out more
information.

MagicJohnson is a HUGE Hillary Clinton supporter,Magic says he's still open to 
doing business with Donald Trump --and wants to be friends with the guy -- as 
long as Hillary is president. May be that is the reason that as johnson support
Clinton and he could do business with Trump.




3. There is a big difference in how many accounts each candidate follows (Gary
Johnson follows over 3K accounts, while Donald Trump follows less than
50). Why do you think this is? How might that affect our analysis?

Trump pay much more attention for his bussiness and his family member such as 
Trump Organization, Trump golf and Tiffany Trump.
Gary Johnson pay much more attention on news or publich information such as journalist.

The data that from Trump is few and cannot reflect the actual information which we want
such as his hobbit.



4. The follower graph we've collected is incomplete. To expand it, we would
have to also collect the list of accounts followed by each of the
friends. That is, for each user X that Donald Trump follows, we would have to
also collect all the users that X follows. Assuming we again use the API call
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/friends/ids, how many requests will
we have to make? Given how Twitter does rate limiting
(https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting), approximately how many
minutes will it take to collect this data?


In order to get the "friends of friends" of each candidate. we need to call twitter request for 'friends/ids'.
After using below command to fetch the friends of each candidate

print(len(list(friend_counts.keys())))

we can get 7686 friends and we need to request 7686 times twitter to find the friends of the 7686 people.

Meanwhile, 15 Requests / 15-min window (user auth), so we can finish it in (7686)/15 *15= 7695 min.
